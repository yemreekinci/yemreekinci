# About Me:
Hi, I'm Emre  <br>I'm a software developer focused on C# / .NET Core <br>I enjoy building clean, scalable applications and learning new technologies.  <br><br>Currently working on backend projects. <br> I build projects following a growth in complexity, starting with simple architectures and gradually moving to more advanced, domain- and modular-driven designs.

- [x] ~~Level 1 – Layered Monolith: Single-project folder-based Controller–Service–Repository architecture with EF Core.~~
- [ ] Level 2 – Clean Architecture: Project-based layer separation with strict dependency inversion.
- [ ] Level 3 – Clean + DDD + CQRS: Aggregate-driven domain model with command/query separation and domain events.
- [ ] Level 4 – Modular Monolith: Isolated business modules with explicit boundaries inside a single deployable unit.
- [ ] Level 5 – Microservices: Independently deployable services communicating via event-driven patterns.

### Current Level
Level 2 – Clean Architecture (In Progress)
